I’m a teacher, mentor and adventurer at heart and possibly the most positive person on Earth. I find myself most at home in positions of leadership responsible for large groups of people, or in positions where I can pass along knowledge that I have to others.

In 2014, I left a comfortable job as an assistant coordinator for the University of Toronto’s International Foundation Program to pursue more adventure and meaning in my life. Since then I’ve spent 14 out of the last 18 months travelling around the world and organizing trips for a travelling community of designers, developers, and other creative types called [Hacker Paradise](http://hackerparadise.org).
