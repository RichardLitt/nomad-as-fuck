I'm a nomad. I grew up in New England, and then lived in Europe for the better part of a decade, first doing my undergraduate in Edinburgh, and then for two years in Germany and Malta and Switzerland. I returned to living permanently in the US, first in Brooklyn, and then SF, then Boston, with a stint in Southeast Asia in between. I've been spending a lot of time in Montr√©al recently, but it's anyone's guess where I'll be next week.

At some point, I realized I knew a ton of awesome nomads, and I wanted to profile them. So, while I was in Portugal, I made this site. It's stupid and silly but I like it.

People think that being a remote worker just means telecommuting in your PJs. I want to dispel that notion and point out the awesome in the universe. Let's go.
