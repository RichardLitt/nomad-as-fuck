I'm a nomad. I grew up in New England, and then lived in Europe for seven years, first doing my undergraduate in Edinburgh, and then for two years in Germany and Malta and Switzerland. I returned to living permanently in the US, first in Brooklyn, and then SF, before heading back out for three months to South East Asia. I’ve recently moved back to Boston. I’ve got books and a bed and stuff.

At some point recently, I also realized that I am no longer nomad as fuck. And I miss that. So, I got on a flight. And made this site in Portugal. In an hour.

People think that being a remote worker just means telecommuting in your PJs. I want to dispel that notion and point out the awesome in the universe. Let's go.
