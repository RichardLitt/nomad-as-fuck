### Where are you from?

Milwaukee, WI (Brew City!)

### What do you do?

Founder of Venture with Impact - we bring remote-working professionals abroad for one month or longer and set them up with accommodation, workspace, and curated cultural experiences.

### How are you nomadic?

I hop around to our various program locations (Colombia, Thailand, Portugal and Peru) working remotely and onsite for Venture with Impact.  

### What's your favorite part of being a nomad?

Always being abroad, it assuages my constant curiosity.

### What's your least favorite part?

Venture with Impact is still in start-up mode, so bootstrapping and hustling, although I kinda love it too.

### What's your craziest story?

Here’s a few…

Breaking into the rooftop of a South Korean skyscraper, and getting caught…
Assisting the birth of a 14 year old girl in rural Venezuela…
The time I found out I had brain cancer… (all is well now)

### What's next for you?

Full steam ahead with Venture with Impact, until all the world’s professionals have experienced a month living abroad.
