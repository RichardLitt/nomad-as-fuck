### Where are you from?
I'm born in the city of Casablanca in Morocco. I then grew up in France, between Paris and Montpellier. I actually lived in many different cities in France! I guess I already had quite a nomadic life before I even realized it ðŸ˜‰

### What do you do?
I'm a software engineer. Currently, I'm contracting for an Australian company called De [Republica](https://derepublica.com.au), working on the [PoseyCo](https://poseyco.com) app. It's an app that helps you find the most photogenic, pose-worthy places for you to snap a pic' at!

### How are you nomadic?
I left the country I called home, France, back in 2011 and haven't been back since. I mainly lived in China and Thailand since then, exploring Asia one city/country at a time ðŸ™‚ I'm more of a nomadic expat in that I like to have a city as an home-base (Beijing, Chiang Mai, Bangkok) where I usually have a permanent residence that enables me to go travel easily and often.

### What's your favourite part of being a nomad?
I definitely like the freedom, the people and the memories. I find it interesting to experience life abroad without knowing where we will be going next weekend or next year. In different cities, things can be drastically different (life, culture, people, customs, etc.) but somehow, you know it's gonna be ok and you'll just fit in, meet new people, discover new things etc.

### What's your least favourite part?
Well as I said, you get to meet a lot of new people. One problem is that too often these relationships stay very superficial as people come and go all the time. It can be hard to create long-term meaningful bonds.

### What's your craziest story?
There's that one day the night started in Thailand and finished in Cambodia, but I won't speak about it.

### What's next for you?
For now I've planned to stay around Asia, there's still some cities/countries I'd like to visit on my to-do list and I still quite enjoy the life here in Thailand. I guess I'll start considering going back "home" when I'll approach 30? ðŸ˜œ
