### Where are you from?
I'm born in 🇲🇦 Morocco and I grew up in 🇫🇷 France. In France, I lived in many different cities: Montesson, Nanterre, Bois d'Arcy, Jouy-le-Moutier, Clamart, Boissy-Saint-Léger and Montpellier (if you're not French all might not ring a bell, just dropping it here for all the homies)! I guess that shaped the nomad in me at an early age, on a smaller scale 😉

### What do you do?
I'm a 💻 software engineer so people tend to think I just write code all day long. Even if there's a part of truth, I always try to have a great work/life balance. My first gig abroad was in Beijing. Back then I was working on a [CMS](https://www.bloc.net/) (something like Wordpress) but the twist was that to test our own CMS, we had a website called WeLiveInBeijing.com. It grew to be one of the biggest social network in town and that sure was a [lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMNzH6mAIak) [of](https://www.instagram.com/weliveinbeijing/) [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22rw-OSySQk)! 🎉

### How are you nomadic?
I left France back in 2011 and haven't looked back since. I mainly lived in 🇨🇳 China and 🇹🇭 Thailand for the time being, exploring Asia one city/country at a time 🌏 I'm more of a nomadic expat' in that I like to have a city as a homebase (Beijing, Chiang Mai, Bangkok) where I hodl permanent residence, which enables me to go travel easily and often without ever having to go back.  
I also remember being based in Chiang Mai back in 2014 when [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio) first launched [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com). I somehow inherited a "founding member" badge [there](https://nomadlist.com/@kytwb).  
I guess all that combined makes me pretty nomadic! 😜

### What's your favourite part of being a nomad?
Well, you get to do/see things and meet people you would never have once you hit the road. I've stopped counting but I think I've met people from virtually all over through the years. You get introduced to different cultures, different customs etc. It's really eye-opening to understand that what you once considered normal life is, in fact, just a drop in the pool of the possible way-of-life there is out there.

I don't have a specific favourite part, but I know I'm grateful for all the incredible things I get to experience since I chose this way-of-life: waking up on a boat to the beautiful scenaries of 🇻🇳 Halong Bay; getting to spend a wild night in the infamous Chung King Mansion of 🇭🇰 Hong Kong; falling in love with the vibes of George Town in 🇲🇾 Penang etc.

I've always been curious by nature and I just can't stop discovering new places, meeting new people and living new experiences. Being nomad is just my favourite part of being nomad (that's deep, *ain't it*).

### What's your least favourite part?
Well I have quite some stories with 👮‍♂️ immigration officers and consulates, again recently in 🇸🇬 Singapore and 🇮🇩 Bali, mainly because I have a Moroccan passport. Lot of people take it for granted, but being nomadic with a "weak" passport can be a tough thing, so be ready if you're in the same situation! 💪 

Another thing I'm still having difficulties with gravitates around friends, relationships and 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 family. I had some major fuckups along the way, which I don't particularly associate with being nomadic, but being far away from the people with whom you have true bonds can make things even more difficult when life hits you. If anybody reading this relates, feel free to reach out if you want to!

### What's your craziest story?

I'm gonna skip the crazy stories related to partying as they're not specific to being a nomad, but there's that one night that started in Thailand and randomly finished in 🇰🇭 Cambodia which is worth a mention. 

Otherwise, and in no specific order: I ended up in the 🏆 [Guiness World Records](https://scontent.fbkk8-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/600285_10200948845589338_1941667577_n.jpg?oh=cd2bf19568698b7a77b858c2854e5d26&oe=5B17A56E) book; met [Iron Man](https://www.facebook.com/mouafik/videos/vb.1411969236/10201656824648372/); been *interviewed* by the FSB in 🇷🇺 Moscow; met my 💔 ex-wife; co-produced a 🎥 [rap music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNihhVRMPdE); got asked by some angry Chinese police to delete 📸 pictures I took in the middle of a big [anti-Japan manifestation](https://www.facebook.com/mouafik/media_set?set=a.4646986578624.2190078.1411969236&type=3) *(#thuglife)*, etc.

Overall, I couldn't say it any better than [Ryan](https://nomadasfuck.com/2017-12/ryan-hupfer) already has in a previous post: "Crazy quickly becomes the norm when traveling and living in other countries".  

### What's next for you?

Well, I have two upcoming things I'm excited about!  
First, my mom is coming to Thailand for a whole month 😍 That's going to be awesome! We're gonna be able to tour around together, celebrate Songkran (her first!) and, more importantly, spend my birthday together for the first time in years.  
Second, I just finished working on an app called [PoseyCo](https://poseyco.com) *(soon to be released)* and I'm now getting ready to start a new venture with yet another interesting and talented team, which is just bliss. ✨
