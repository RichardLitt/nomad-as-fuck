### Where are you from?
Born in Santa Barbara, raised in San Diego but have always had a travel bug. Studied abroad in Italy twice during school, just got back from 6 weeks in Costa Rica.

### What do you do?
I am a freelance graphic designer who specializes in helping small, service based brands turn their business vision into visuals.

### How are you nomadic?
I am 100% self employed freelancer and all of my work can be done with the adobe creative suite + high speed internet.

### What's your favorite part of being a nomad?
What I love most about being a nomad is that life becomes comfortably unpredictable. I don't know where I will be in 3 weeks, 3 months or 3 years from now and it's both terrifying and liberating.

### What's your least favorite part?
My least favorite part is trying to strike the right balance between work and play. When you're living in a new city, it's really enticing to procrastinate work and go explore but I have to remember to get my work done and keep my clients happy as well.

### What's your craziest story?
When studying abroad in Florence, a friend and I snuck into Men's Fashion week without a badge and jumped over hedges to avoid security.

### What's next for you?
Taking up semi permanent residence in Lake Tahoe, NV while I learn to fly my new drone. Then, off to South Africa Jan 19!
